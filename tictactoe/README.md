### Tic Tac Toe
## How it's Work :
# Normal Game :
- You play one after the other
- You need to give the numworks to the next player
- And repeat ...
# "AI" Game :
- Before playing against the "AI" you need to enter a number between 0-10
- This number determines the difficulty of the "AI"
- The "AI" decides between playing a random spot (considered as an error) or playing normaly.
- By playing normaly the "AI" will always defend if there is threat to win
